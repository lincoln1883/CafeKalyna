            <p>In a very difficult time for our country, it is very important that people know and understand what Ukraine is. We took it upon ourselves to present Ukrainian cuisine in Sheffield in Britain. Thanks to the support of caring people, we have a good start and there is a place where many Ukrainians feel  themselves home. Cafe Kalyna is a Ukrainian social enterprise, and in the future we want to create as many jobs as possible.  currently we are  running free English lessons, and planning to start Ukrainian lessons for the British.  We really want to make the Kalyna cafe a treasure trove of Ukrainian culture and the creativity of Ukrainian artists, where British could discover it better.  A large part of our activity is charity.  Currently we need support, foremost financial.  We invite you to our crowdfunding page and ask you to share this post, encourage caring Britons. We are always open to any ideas or suggestions.</p>
